# COMP6321-fall-2019

Lab exercises & Project code

## Comments

Project code under the folder ```Project``` is referenced by another repository (https://github.com/Yixuan-Lee/COMP6321-Project.git) which was the team workplace for the project showing the commits and contribution of all team members. However, that repository might not be up-to-date. For the purpose of backup, I gather the final submit version of the project code here under the ```Project``` folder. For the contribution on the project, please check on the reference link.
